	2)rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.
	3)drain again and then add them in a pressure cooker. add 3 cups water and stir well.
	4)pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. if they 		are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more. the urad dal should melt in the 		mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. you can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to 		check the doneness. the same rule applies for rajma too. keep the cooked beans aside.

	7)saute till the spices become aromatic.
	8)then add ½ cup finely chopped onions.
